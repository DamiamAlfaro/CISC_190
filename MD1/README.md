If you happen to close the window where the output is shown - called the Terminal - you can make it reappear by selecting View and then Show Terminal in the main BlueJ window.

Include the mandatory code comment header the top of the java file:, see: Java Source Code Comment Header

Comment each line of code carefully with the understanding you currently have. A comment is an annotation in the code meant for humans to read; it is completely ignored by Java.

System.out.println("Message");
To run your program in BlueJ, right-click in the box with the class' name in the main window, and select the main method.

Submit:

A screenshot of the program running (or having run) in BlueJ
The program: either as
The Java file (.java)
or:
A jar file containing the BlueJ project.
Here is how you create a .jar file:
In menu in the main BlueJ window, select Project, then Create Jar File. 
Make sure Include source and Include Bluej project files are checked so that BlueJ includes all the java files.
Then click Continue.
After that, give the file a name and save it.
You can check the contents of the .jar file by opening it in BlueJ:
In the menu in the main BlueJ window, select Project, then Open ZIP/Jar File, and you should see everything as you saved it. (If the file has the same name as the project folder, move the project folder to another folder).
