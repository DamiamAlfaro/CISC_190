Week 2
Be sure to implement all the feedback you have received for the previous part(s) before implementing the new features.


New Game Features

The board now also contains 7 trolls that will take away all your treasure if you land on one!
7 distinct trolls (not on top of each other or a treasure)
 

User Stories

As a player, when I click on the board, in addition to a treasure or nothing, I may encounter a troll at random positions.
As a player, when I click on a troll, I lose all my treasures, but the game goes on.
As a player, when the game is over, I can see where all the treasures and trolls are located on the board.
 

Technical Implementation

Follow the these directions:

Implement each story one at a time in the order given.
Keep each class in a separate file.
Extend the EmptyButton class to create a TrollButton class instances of which are on the board
Change the look of the button when a user clicks on it: change the text or the icon
 

Work to Submit

Submit one jar file with the entire project folder. Be sure to include all comments and to indent consistently as you will not be able to resubmit after the deadline.
Also either: Write a user's guide document to the game, including screenshots of the game in play
Or: produce a 3 minute video demonstrating each of the User Stories.
Be sure to update your work if you had feedback last week - otherwise you will the same feedback again.
Submit work early to get feedback; the deadline is a deadline
