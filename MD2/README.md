Complete the following Programming Challenges:

Simple Tip Calculator
Implement a program that inputs an amount and prints out the tip amount for a 20% tip. Hint: use this as a comment for the class.
Example: input 50 and the output should be 10. It may look like:
Enter amount ($): 50
The tip is ($): 10

Enter amount ($): 150.50
The tip is ($): 30.1
Start the a new BlueJ project for all the challenges in this module.
Create a class called SimpleTipCalculator for your main method
Use command-line/text (Scanner and print) for both user input and output
Copy & paste the following pseudo-code into your main and use it as an outline for your program (recommended but optional):
public static void main()
{
   // Ask user for input
   // Calculate tip amount
   // Print out tip amount
}
Do not worry about the number of decimals being printed
Hint: use a variable to hold the tip percent. What are you going to name it?
Hint: use nextDouble() to input numbers.

Advanced Tip Calculator
Implement a program that inputs an amount and a tip percent and prints out the tip amount.
Example: input 50 and 18 and the output should be 9. It may look like:
Enter amount ($): 50.50
Enter tip (%): 20
The tip is ($): 10.1

Enter amount ($): 150
Enter tip (%): 18
The tip is ($): 27
Create a class called AdvancedTipCalculator for your main method
Use command-line/text (Scanner and print) for both user input and output
Use the following pseudo-code:
// Ask user for inputs
// Calculate tip amount
// Print out result
Do not worry about the number of decimals being printed

Bill Calculator
Implement a program that inputs an amount and a tip percent and prints out the amount plus tip.
Example: input 50 and 20 and the output should be 60.
Create a class called BillCalculator for your main method
Use command-line/text (Scanner and print) for both user input and output
Use the following pseudo-code:
// Ask user for inputs
// Calculate tip amount
// Calculate bill amount
// Print out result
Do not worry about the number of decimals being printed

Fancy Bill Calculator
Implement a program that inputs an amount and a tip percent and prints out the amount plus tip.
Example: input 50 and 20 and the output should be 60.
Create a class called FancyBillCalculator for your main method.
Use graphics (JOptionPane) for both user input and output.
Do not worry about the number of decimals being shown

Retail Calculator
Implement a program that inputs a wholesale price of an item, and a markup percent, and then prints out the retail price of the item, including markup and sales taxes. The state tax is 2% and the city tax is 8%.
The final retail price is the wholesale price + markup + tax of (wholesale price + markup).
Example: input $50 and 100%, so the sales price before tax is $100, and the final retain price with tax is $110. It may look like:
Enter wholesale price ($): 50
Enter markup (%): 100
Sales price before tax ($): 100
State tax ($): 2
City tax ($): 8
Retail price ($): 110

Enter wholesale price ($): 100
Enter markup (%): 50
Sales price before tax ($): 150
State tax ($): 3
City tax ($): 12
Retail price ($): 165
Create a class called RetailCalculator for your main method.
Hint: use variables to hold the tax percentages. Hint, hint: what are you going to name them?
Hint: markup and tax is calculated same way you calculate tips.
You have full creative freedom to choose input and output methods.
